## General Info

In this game's current stage, you play in abandoned hospital which you need to survive until dawn.\
The game was inspired by [Hopeless: The Dark Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpHrvWfgtfY&t) (:point_left: gameplay - not mine)\
Unfortunately this project was created in our VR lab at the college (don't have a VR set at home) then Covid-19 started and I couldn't have access to the lab again to finish developing the game.\
\
In this course we learn all about the XR world and the basics of VR programming.\
